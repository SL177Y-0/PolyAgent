Trading Agent (Real Trading)  
(Project Brief)
Unimarket
1. Goal
Build a simple, modular trading agent system that can place real trades on prediction markets.
The goal of this phase is to prove:
* market data can be monitored,

* tradeable events can be detected,

* strategies can decide actions,

* real orders can be executed safely,

* and positions + P&L can be tracked correctly.

This is an initial real-trading version, not a full-scale production system.

2. High-Level Flow (Must Follow)
   * Market Data
   *  → Event Detection
   *  → Strategy Decision
   *  → Risk Check
   *  → Order Execution (Real)
   *  → Position & P&L Tracking
   *  → Logging


Each block should be implemented cleanly and separately.
________________


3. Data Scouting (Simple)
   * Fetch live market price periodically (e.g. every 30–60 seconds)

   * Maintain a short rolling price history

   * Orderbook usage is optional (basic spread or liquidity summary only)

Example output:
      * {
      *   "market_id": "X",
      *   "price": 0.42,
      *   "timestamp": "..."
      * }


________________


4. Event Detection (Spike Only)
Detect price spike events.
Logic:
      * Compare current price with historical prices

      * Trigger a spike event if price moves ≥ configured % within:

         * 10 minutes

         * 30 minutes

         * OR cumulatively over ~60 minutes

Example event:
            * {
            *   "event": "spike",
            *   "direction": "up",
            *   "magnitude": 0.08
            * }


No trading logic here — detection only.

5. Strategy (Rule-Based, LLM-Ready)
Implement one rule-based strategy.
Strategy: Spike Sam (Fade Spike)
Current required behavior:
            * Spike UP → sell

            * Spike DOWN → buy

            * Ignore weak or noisy spikes

Decision output:
               * {
               *   "action": "buy | sell | ignore",
               *   "size_usd": 2
               * }


Design Requirement
Strategy logic must be encapsulated in a single decision function, for example:
               * decide_action(event, market_state, config) → decision


This is required so that LLM support can be added later as a simple function extension (not part of this project).
LLM integration is explicitly out of scope for now.

6. Risk Controls (Mandatory)
Before placing any real order, enforce:
               * Min and Max trade size (USD)

               * Max one open position per market

               * Max holding time (minutes)

               * Optional stop-loss %

               * Entry and Exit (take profit %s)

If any rule fails → do not place the order.
Risk checks must be applied before execution.

7. Order Execution (Real Trading)
                  * Place real buy/sell orders using the provided trading API

                  * Use market orders or best-available execution

                  * Track:

                     * order ID

                     * fill price

                     * filled size

                     * execution timestamp

No advanced execution logic required.
________________


8. Position & P&L Tracking
Track per market:
                        * current position (long / short / flat)

                        * entry price

                        * current price

                        * realized P&L

                        * unrealized P&L

                        * holding duration

This can be in-memory or persisted simply.
________________


9. Monitoring & Logs
Log all key actions clearly:
                           * Spike detected

                           * Strategy decision

                           * Risk approval / rejection

                           * Order placed

                           * Order filled

                           * Position closed

                           * P&L updated

Logs should make it easy to answer:
“Why did the agent trade here?”

10. Configuration
Agent configuration should be simple and editable:
                              * {
                              *   "market_id": "X",
                              *   "spike_threshold": 0.08,
                              *   "trade_size_usd": 2,
                              *   "max_hold_minutes": 60
                              * }

11. Deliverables
The freelancer should deliver:
                              * Working source code

                              * Simple README explaining:

                                 * how to run the agent

                                 * how to configure markets

                                    * Example run showing:

                                       * live data

                                       * real trade placement

                                       * position and P&L updates

12. Tech Notes
                                          * Language: Python or TypeScript

                                          * Clean, readable code

                                          * No UI required

                                          * No ML / LLM work required

                                          * Focus on correctness and safety

                                             * Agent runs continuously

                                             * Spike events are detected

                                             * Real orders are placed correctly

                                             * Risk limits are respected

                                             * Positions and P&L are accurate

                                             * Logs clearly explain behavior
