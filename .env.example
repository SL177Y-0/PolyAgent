# PolyAgent Configuration
# ========================
# 
# IMPORTANT: This file is NO LONGER USED!

# All configuration is now managed through the frontend UI.
# When you create a bot, you'll configure:
#
# WALLET SETTINGS (per bot):
# - Private key (64 hex characters, without 0x prefix)
# - Signature type: 0 = EOA, 2 = Proxy
# - Funder address (only for Proxy mode)
#
# MARKET SETTINGS (per bot):
# - Market slug or token ID
# - Trading profile (normal, live, edge)
#
# STRATEGY SETTINGS (per bot):
# - Spike threshold percentage
# - Trade size in USD
# - Take profit / Stop loss percentages
# - Max hold time
# - And more...
#
# GLOBAL SETTINGS (in Settings panel):
# - Slippage tolerance
# - Liquidity requirements
# - WebSocket settings
# - Killswitch behavior
# - Daily loss limits
#
# Configuration is stored in:
# - Bot configs: data/bots/*.json
# - Global settings: data/settings.json
#
# See README.md for more information on getting started.
